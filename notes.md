# GitHub
I learned how to commit, push, pull, and do version control with Git. In the markdown tutorial I learned a lot, I only used the basics before like making words **bold** or in *italics*, now I know a lot more techniques.

# AWS Route 53
The name server (NS) record contains the names of the authoritative name servers that authorize you to place DNS records in this DNS server. Those same authoritative name servers are listed with the registrar that you leased your domain name from. That way the authoritative name server can verify that the DNS records and the DNS registration match and are authorized to represent the domain name when defining DNS records. Otherwise a hacker could just add DNS records and take over your domain name.

The start of authority (SOA) record provides contact information about the owner of this domain name.

# Git & GitHub
SHA: hashing algorithm that represents each git version
You can create a personal access token through settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens

# History & Asking questions
Three stages of internet history:
Creation of internet
Creation of HTML and HTTP to allow sharing documents
Creation of CSS and JavaScript to allow interactivity
The beginnings of the internet were created as a network to aid in resisting a nuclear attack
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) was created early on by Berners-Lee (the web father) and defined the World Wide Web, revolutionary by having hyperlinks to link to other documents
Berners-Lee also created the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
CSS was later created, without it the entire internet would have looked exactly the same on every page
JavaScript was created to allow interactivity
Asking questions:
Sum up problem in one simple, specific question, then explain details
Help others reproduce problem
Donâ€™t start over with established code, embrace and build upon it

# Technology Stack & AWS
Technology stack is all the technologies used to deliver a web application
Our stack consists of the following: React for the web framework, Caddy as the web server hosted on AWS, running web services with Node.js, and MongoDB as the database
Usually I will use the stack that the company has set
AWS is like renting a mini computer for running our web server
